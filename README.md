# i18n scripts

To work correctly this package requires a `gettext` installation.

## generateJson

No longer renames `.po` files with `.toLocale​Lower​Case()` or maps local locales. We need a new script for that.

## Contributing

We use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) in this repo to automate commit messages formatting. You have to have `commitizen` installed globally.
